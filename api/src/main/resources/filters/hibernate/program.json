        Goals:
            1- Include users that work in at least one program as the authenticated user
            2- Include users that don't work in any program
            4- Include users that have zero roles
            3- Otherwise exclude the rest

        Assumptions:
            1- filters are applied where there is an authenticated user

        Parameters:
            userProgramRoles: The collection of all of the authenticated user's program roles
            allProgramRoles: The collection of all roles linked to programs in the datafilter_entity_basis_map table
