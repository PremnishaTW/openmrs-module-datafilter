        Goals:
            1- Include users that work in at least one program as the authenticated user
            2- Include users that don't work in any program
            4- Include users that have zero roles or privileges
            3- Otherwise exclude the rest

        Assumptions:
            1- filters are applied where there is an authenticated user

        Parameters:
            userProgramPrivileges: The collection of all of the authenticated user's program privileges
            allProgramPrivileges: The collection of all program privileges in the system
